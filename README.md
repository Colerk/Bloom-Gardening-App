## Usage

Spend some time on our information page reviewing what plants you find interesting and want to grow.

From there, our planning page will provide all the critical information you need to grow each of those vegetables, including their difficulty, climate, and sunlight requirements. Select all the vegetables you want to grow and add them to your Vegetable Basket. Once your ready to get started, click Build My Garden to create your specific dashboard.

The dashboard provies weather updates to help with watering requirements, a table showing all your vegetables with their planting instructions, and your harvest and maintenance schedule. Once you have planted them, check them off to populate your garden maintenance and harvest schedules.
